# Adding new content

In this example, you can see three jQuery selections are made. Each selection uses a different method to amend the content of the list. the first adds a new notice before the list, the second adds a + symbol before the hot items, and the third adds a new element to the end of the list.

The ul element is selected, and the .before method is used to insert a new paragraph before the list. Selects all li elements whose class attribute contains a value of hot and uses the .prepend method to add a plus symbol + before the text. A new li element is created and stored in a variable. Then the last li element is selected, and the new element is added using the .after method.
